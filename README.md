This NBA hangman game stores an array of NBA player's names (legends and current). The correct answer is randomly assigned each game, and the user has 9 tries to guess the letters. For people who like basketball, this game can be very entertaining/ addicting. It was developed by myself, Nicholas Ciambrone.
